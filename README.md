### Chapter Questions
<details>
  <summary>Q1. What is statistics? How are data and statistics related?</summary>

  <blockquote>

  Statistics is the study of how to best collect, analyze, and draw conclusions from data, where data can be understood as information gained from observable events. (_Open Intro_ 8)

  </blockquote>

  <summary>Q2. Consider the stent study presented in section 1.1. How does the role of randomness make data analysis more challenging?</summary>

  <blockquote>

  In the stent study presented in section 1.1, the control group surprisingly had a lower rate of patients with a stroke (12%) than the treatment group (20%). However, in most natural processes there is a factor of randomness (chaos) resulting in a variation of values. Consequently, a difference like this should not stand alone. Those conducting the study have to ask if the difference in values is _significant_, meaning that the difference is too unlikely to have occurred by random chance/variation.

  <summary>Q3. Describe the four types of variables introduced in section 1.2.2.</summary>

  <blockquote>

  Broadly speaking, variables can be divided into two primary groups: _categorical_ and _numerical_. Each of these can further be divided into two respective subgroups. Categorical variables are either _nominal_ or _ordinal_. Numerical variables are either _discrete_ or _continuous_.

  Nominal variables have no natural order to them (e.g. eye color, city of birth), while ordinal variables do have a natural order despite being non-numerical (e.g. Likert scales). Discrete variables are countable, meaning they increase incrementally and one can therefore meaningfully identify the "next" value (e.g. points in a game, dollar values). Continuous variables, on the other hand, do not have a "next" element and can instead be represented by intervals that are dense with values.

  </blockquote>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Q4. Describe in your own words the difference between an observational study and an experiment?</summary>

  <blockquote>

  An observational study collects data--whether past, present, or across time--without attempting to affect the subjects via treatment. An experiment, on the other hand, applies a treatment to some or all of the subjects studied. Experiments are typically conducted when researchers want to identify a causal connection.

  <summary>E1.2 Researchers studying the effect of antibiotic treatment for acute
sinusitis compared to symptomatic treatments randomly assigned 166 adults diagnosed with acute sinusitis to
one of two groups: treatment or control. Study participants received either a 10-day course of amoxicillin (an
antibiotic) or a placebo similar in appearance and taste. The placebo consisted of symptomatic treatments
such as acetaminophen, nasal decongestants, etc. At the end of the 10-day period, patients were asked if
they experienced improvement in symptoms. The distribution of responses is summarized below.</summary>

    <summary>(a) What percent of patients in the treatment group experienced improvement in symptoms?</summary>

    <summary>(d) Your findings so far might suggest a real difference in effectiveness of antibiotic and placebo treatments
for improving symptoms of sinusitis. However, this is not the only possible conclusion that can be drawn
based on your findings so far. What is one other possible explanation for the observed difference between
the percentages of patients in the antibiotic and placebo treatment groups that experience improvement
in symptoms of sinusitis?</summary>

## Chapter 2

### Chapter Questions
<details>
  <summary>Q1. When would one use a scatterplot? a histogram?</summary>

  <blockquote>

  A scatterplot is used to provide a case-by-case view of data for two numerical variables (_Open Intro_ 41), typically to see whether those variables are associated or correlated in some way.

  A histogram, on the other hand, is used to identify the distribution of a single numerical variable by collecting its values into bins and plotting the frequency or relative frequency of those bins.

  </blockquote>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Q2. Example 2.8 discusses weighted means. In what circumstances might it be preferable to use a weighted mean?</summary>

  <blockquote>

  In some sense, all means are weighted; however, the typical mean simply equally weights all values. However, there are many cases where the weights of values should not be equal. For example, an instructor commonly assigns different weights to different assignments or assignment categories so that they affect a student's final grade differently. For example, an exam grade is typically weighted with a higher percentage of a student's overall grade than an individual homework grade.

  </blockquote>

<details>
  <summary>Q3. What advantages does a box plot have over a dot plot or histogram?</summary>

  <blockquote>

  Dotplots, histograms, and box plots are all different representations of a variable's distribution. A box plot, however, typically allows explicit representation of outliers (if 1.5xIQR beyond the box) as well as clear demarcations of the five-number summary and thus which quartiles of the distribution are closest together or most spread apart.

  </blockquote>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Q4. Why are transformations applied to data?</summary>

  <blockquote>

  Transformations are typically applied for two distinct reasons: To see clustered data more clearly, and to determine the behavior of clustered data points--for example, to determine whether the data follows a logarithmic or exponential growth pattern.

  </blockquote>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Q5. When would a bar plot be appropriate? What is the difference between a bar plot and a histogram?</summary>

  <blockquote>

  Bar plots are typically used to compare summary/aggregate data related to the categories of one or multiple categorical variables, whereas histograms are used to show distributions of numerical variables. (These can also be multi-dimensional, but sometimes it's a bit much to read.)

## Chapter 8, Sections 8.1 - 8.3

### Chapter Questions
<details>
  <summary>Q1. What does a linear regression model assume?</summary>

  <blockquote>

  A linear regression model assumes (_Open Intro_ 318):
  1. linearity: the data should trend in the shape of a line
  2. nearly normal residuals
  3. constant variability
  4. independent observations

  <blockquote>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Q2. What does correlation measure? Is it always the case that two variables with a strong association will have a large correlation? Why or why not?</summary>

  <blockquote>

  Correlation measures the strength of the _linear_ trend of two variables. Two variables might have very strong non-linear association (e.g. quadratic or exponential) and thus have low correlation.

  </blockquote>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Q3. What does the slope of a regression line tell you about the relationship between the explanatory and response variables?</summary>

  <blockquote>

  The slope of the regression line tells you the model's average rate of change of the response variable per one unit change of the explanatory variable.

  </blockquote>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Q4. What does the R^2 statistic measure?</summary>

  <blockquote>

  R^2 measures the proportion of the response variable's variation that can be explained by a linear model.

  </blockquote>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Q5. What is an indicator variable and how are indicator variables related to linear regression?</summary>

  <blockquote>

  An indicator variable recasts a categorical variable in binary, numerical terms (typically 0 and 1), which allows linear regression to be run on a scatterplot associating the indicator variable with another numerical variable.
