### Chapter Questions
<details>
  <summary>Q1. What is statistics? How are data and statistics related?</summary>

  <blockquote>

  Statistics is the study of how to best collect, analyze, and draw conclusions from data, where data can be understood as information gained from observable events. (_Open Intro_ 8)

  </blockquote>


</details>

<details>
  <summary>Q2. Consider the stent study presented in section 1.1. How does the role of randomness make data analysis more challenging?</summary>

  <blockquote>

  In the stent study presented in section 1.1, the control group surprisingly had a lower rate of patients with a stroke (12%) than the treatment group (20%). However, in most natural processes there is a factor of randomness (chaos) resulting in a variation of values. Consequently, a difference like this should not stand alone. Those conducting the study have to ask if the difference in values is _significant_, meaning that the difference is too unlikely to have occurred by random chance/variation.

  </blockquote>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Q3. Describe the four types of variables introduced in section 1.2.2.</summary>

  <blockquote>

  Broadly speaking, variables can be divided into two primary groups: _categorical_ and _numerical_. Each of these can further be divided into two respective subgroups. Categorical variables are either _nominal_ or _ordinal_. Numerical variables are either _discrete_ or _continuous_.

  Nominal variables have no natural order to them (e.g. eye color, city of birth), while ordinal variables do have a natural order despite being non-numerical (e.g. Likert scales). Discrete variables are countable, meaning they increase incrementally and one can therefore meaningfully identify the "next" value (e.g. points in a game, dollar values). Continuous variables, on the other hand, do not have a "next" element and can instead be represented by intervals that are dense with values.

  </blockquote>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Q4. Describe in your own words the difference between an observational study and an experiment?</summary>

  <blockquote>

  An observational study collects data--whether past, present, or across time--without attempting to affect the subjects via treatment. An experiment, on the other hand, applies a treatment to some or all of the subjects studied. Experiments are typically conducted when researchers want to identify a causal connection.

  <summary>E1.2 Researchers studying the effect of antibiotic treatment for acute
sinusitis compared to symptomatic treatments randomly assigned 166 adults diagnosed with acute sinusitis to
one of two groups: treatment or control. Study participants received either a 10-day course of amoxicillin (an
antibiotic) or a placebo similar in appearance and taste. The placebo consisted of symptomatic treatments
such as acetaminophen, nasal decongestants, etc. At the end of the 10-day period, patients were asked if
they experienced improvement in symptoms. The distribution of responses is summarized below.</summary>

<blockquote>

  <details>
    <summary>(a) What percent of patients in the treatment group experienced improvement in symptoms?</summary>

  <blockquote>
  66 / 85 = 77.647% of patients in the treatment group reported improvement in symptoms.
  </blockquote>

  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>(b) What percent experienced improvement in symptoms in the control group?</summary>

  <blockquote>
  65 / 81 = 80.247% of patients in the control group reported improvement in symptoms.
  </blockquote>

  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>(c) In which group did a higher percentage of patients experience improvement in symptoms?</summary>

  <blockquote>
  A higher percentage of patients in the control group (!) reported improvement in symptoms.
  </blockquote>

  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>(d) Your findings so far might suggest a real difference in effectiveness of antibiotic and placebo treatments
for improving symptoms of sinusitis. However, this is not the only possible conclusion that can be drawn
based on your findings so far. What is one other possible explanation for the observed difference between
the percentages of patients in the antibiotic and placebo treatment groups that experience improvement
in symptoms of sinusitis?</summary>

  <blockquote>
  Since the placebo consisted of symptomatic treatments and the patients were self-reporting their improvement, it's possible that the patients were more likely to feel better from the placebo regardless of whether the sinusitis was being addressed. In other words, the patients may have been reporting temporary relief as improvement.

  <summary>E1.4 The Buteyko method is a shallow breathing technique devel-
oped by Konstantin Buteyko, a Russian doctor, in 1952. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the Buteyko
method can reduce asthma symptoms and improve quality of life. In a scientific study to determine the
effectiveness of this method, researchers recruited 600 asthma patients aged 18-69 who relied on medication
for asthma treatment. These patients were randomly split into two research groups: one practiced the
Buteyko method and the other did not. Patients were scored on quality of life, activity, asthma symptoms,
and medication reduction on a scale from 0 to 10. On average, the participants in the Buteyko group
experienced a significant reduction in asthma symptoms and an improvement in quality of life.</summary>

<blockquote>

  <details>
  <summary>(a) Identify the main research question of the study.</summary>

  <blockquote>
  Does the Buteyko method reduce asthma symptoms and improve quality of life for people with asthma between ages 18-69?
  </blockquote>

  </details>

  <details>
  <summary>(b) Who are the subjects in this study, and how many are included?</summary>

  <blockquote>
  The subjects of the study are 600 asthma patients aged 18-69.
  </blockquote>

  </details>

  <details>
  <summary>(c) What are the variables in the study? Identify each variable as numerical or categorical. If numerical,
state whether the variable is discrete or continuous. If categorical, state whether the variable is ordinal.</summary>

  <blockquote>
  The variables are

  - quality of life
  - activity
  - asthma symptoms
  - medication reduction

where each is rated on a scale of 0 to 10. This scale is ostensibly numerical > discrete; however, I think that it is functionally ordinal. For example, one could just as meaningfully make the scale A - K, and the difference between, I and K is as meaningful as the difference between 8 and 10.

  <summary>E1.8 Exercise 1.2 introduced a study exploring the effect of antibiotic
treatment for acute sinusitis. Study participants either received either a 10-day course of an antibiotic
(treatment) or a placebo similar in appearance and taste (control). At the end of the 10-day period, patients
were asked if they experienced improvement in symptoms. What are the explanatory and response variables
in this study?</summary>

  <blockquote>

  The explanatory variable is whether the patient took the placebo or the antibiotic treatment; the response variable is whether or not the patients reported improvement in symptoms.

<details>
  <summary>E1.15 Exercise 1.4 introduces a study on using the Buteyko shallow
breathing technique to reduce asthma symptoms and improve quality of life. As part of this study 600
asthma patients aged 18-69 who relied on medication for asthma treatment were recruited and randomly
assigned to two groups: one practiced the Buteyko method and the other did not. Those in the Buteyko
group experienced, on average, a significant reduction in asthma symptoms and an improvement in quality
of life.</summary>

<blockquote>

<details>
<summary>(a) Identify the population of interest and the sample in this study.</summary>

<blockquote>
The population of interest is asthma patients who relied on medication for asthma treatment and were aged 18 - 69 years, and the sample is the 600 asthma patients within that same group who were recruited and randomly assigned into treatment groups.
</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>(b) Comment on whether or not the results of the study can be generalized to the population, and if the findings of the study can be used to establish causal relationships.</summary>

<blockquote>
One should be careful about generalizing from a sample to the population; typically, one wants to duplicate an experiment multiple times with different samples to make an inference for a population. However, the fundamental pieces for inference are there: a fairly large random sample from the population. Likewise, the basic components for causal inference are in place: an experiment with a control group and a treatment group. That said, one typically tries to block subjects into groups to control for variation between sub-populations.

## Chapter 2

### Chapter Questions
<details>
  <summary>Q1. When would one use a scatterplot? a histogram?</summary>

  <blockquote>

  A scatterplot is used to provide a case-by-case view of data for two numerical variables (_Open Intro_ 41), typically to see whether those variables are associated or correlated in some way.

  A histogram, on the other hand, is used to identify the distribution of a single numerical variable by collecting its values into bins and plotting the frequency or relative frequency of those bins.

  </blockquote>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Q2. Example 2.8 discusses weighted means. In what circumstances might it be preferable to use a weighted mean?</summary>

  <blockquote>

  In some sense, all means are weighted; however, the typical mean simply equally weights all values. However, there are many cases where the weights of values should not be equal. For example, an instructor commonly assigns different weights to different assignments or assignment categories so that they affect a student's final grade differently. For example, an exam grade is typically weighted with a higher percentage of a student's overall grade than an individual homework grade.

  </blockquote>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Q3. What advantages does a box plot have over a dot plot or histogram?</summary>

  <blockquote>

  Dotplots, histograms, and box plots are all different representations of a variable's distribution. A box plot, however, typically allows explicit representation of outliers (if 1.5xIQR beyond the box) as well as clear demarcations of the five-number summary and thus which quartiles of the distribution are closest together or most spread apart.

  </blockquote>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Q4. Why are transformations applied to data?</summary>

  <blockquote>

  Transformations are typically applied for two distinct reasons: To see clustered data more clearly, and to determine the behavior of clustered data points--for example, to determine whether the data follows a logarithmic or exponential growth pattern.

  </blockquote>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Q5. When would a bar plot be appropriate? What is the difference between a bar plot and a histogram?</summary>

  <blockquote>

  Bar plots are typically used to compare summary/aggregate data related to the categories of one or multiple categorical variables, whereas histograms are used to show distributions of numerical variables. (These can also be multi-dimensional, but sometimes it's a bit much to read.)

and that the average friend count of users is 190. What do these findings suggest about the shape of the distribution of number of friends of Facebook users?</summary>

<blockquote>

These findings suggest that the distribution shape is skewed right, with outliers in the higher values that pull the mean higher than the median.

<details>
  <summary>E2.16 For each of the following, state whether you expect the distribution to be symmetric, right skewed, or left skewed. Also specify whether the mean or median would best represent a typical observation in the data, and whether the variability of observations would be best represented using the standard deviation or IQR. Explain your reasoning.</summary>

  <blockquote>
    The distribution is likely right-skewed, with a tail into the higher house prices that makes the mean larger than the median. Here, the median is the preferred measure for a typical observation, since the meaningful number of outlier values would pull the mean higher. For similar reasons, the IQR is a better representation of the variability since it depicts the spread of the middle 50% of the houses without being distorted by outlier values like the standard deviation.

    <summary>(b) Housing prices in a country where 25% of the houses cost below $300,000, 50% of the houses cost below $600,000, 75% of the houses cost below $900,000 and very few houses that cost more than $1,200,000.</summary>

  <blockquote>
  The distribution is likely symmetric, meaning the mean is a good representation of the typical value--though, honestly, I'd still rather use the median here, especially since part of the reason that I think the mean is useful here is that it's close to the median. The standard deviation is also not distorted by the extreme values as much, making it more useful. Though, once again, I'd still prefer using the IQR.

    <summary>(c) Number of alcoholic drinks consumed by college students in a given week. Assume that most of these students don’t drink since they are under 21 years old, and only a few drink excessively.</summary>

  <blockquote>
  This distribution is likely skewed right. The median would therefore be the preferred measure of central tendency, since the few unusually high values would distort the typical value by pulling it too high. Here, the IQR would better represent the variability, showing most of the values to the left of the distribution with a few extreme values, which would distort the standard deviation.

other variables. The histogram below shows the distribution of the percentage of the population that is Hispanic in 3,142 counties in the US in 2010. Also shown is a histogram of logs of these values.</summary>

<blockquote>

  <details>
    <summary>(a) Describe the numerical distribution and comment on why we might want to use log-transformed values in analyzing or modeling these data.</summary>

  <blockquote>
  The distribution is heavily right-skewed, meaning that a logarithmic distribution "breaks up" the clustered left portion of the graph so we can see the breakdown of the different power-of-ten ranges. Notice that, once a logarithmic transformation is applied, we have a "normal distribution" to work with.
  </blockquote>

  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>(b) What features of the distribution of the Hispanic population in US counties are apparent in the map but not in the histogram? What features are apparent in the histogram but not the map?</summary>

  <blockquote>
  The map allows us to see _which_ counties are most densely populated with Hispanics and whether those counties tend to cluster near each other--and they do, primarily in urban areas and the west, especially the southwest. The histograms allow us to see which densities are most common and the tendency of the county distributions overall, irrespective of location.
  </blockquote>

  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>(c) Is one visualization more appropriate or helpful than the other? Explain your reasoning. </summary>

<blockquote>

  <details>
    <summary>(a) What features are apparent in the bar plot but not in the pie chart?</summary>

  <blockquote>
  The bar chart's x-axis shows exact numerical values for the relative frequencies. The relative values of each category are also clearer, since you can tell whether a bar is twice or three times the size of another, for example. Finally, it's much easier to determine the descending order of the values by reading from top to bottom rather than clockwise.
  </blockquote>

  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>(b) What features are apparent in the pie chart but not in the bar plot?</summary>

  <blockquote>
  Uh...the colors help distinguish the categories, and it's clearer that all categories are being shown rather than just a subset, since we are being shown a pie that suggests the full 100% of values being represented. With that, it's easier to see that each value is a proportion of 100% and thus it's (somewhat) easier to intuit which categories make bigger pieces of the pie, so to speak.
  </blockquote>

  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>(c) Which graph would you prefer to use for displaying these categorical data? </summary>

  I'd prefer using the bar chart. I definitely prefer reading linearly and having clear comparisons between the categories.

<blockquote>
The best actresses skew strongly to the right, with almost all the winners being under 40 years old, while the best actors are roughly symmetrical around a mean of 43. The standard deviation confirms that the actresses' values are more spread out, and the actresses' mean is lower than that of the actors, despite the right tail pulling the actresses' mean value higher than the typical value.

## Chapter 8, Sections 8.1 - 8.3

### Chapter Questions
<details>
  <summary>Q1. What does a linear regression model assume?</summary>

  <blockquote>

  A linear regression model assumes (_Open Intro_ 318):
  1. linearity: the data should trend in the shape of a line
  2. nearly normal residuals
  3. constant variability
  4. independent observations

  <blockquote>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Q2. What does correlation measure? Is it always the case that two variables with a strong association will have a large correlation? Why or why not?</summary>

  <blockquote>

  Correlation measures the strength of the _linear_ trend of two variables. Two variables might have very strong non-linear association (e.g. quadratic or exponential) and thus have low correlation.

  </blockquote>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Q3. What does the slope of a regression line tell you about the relationship between the explanatory and response variables?</summary>

  <blockquote>

  The slope of the regression line tells you the model's average rate of change of the response variable per one unit change of the explanatory variable.

  </blockquote>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Q4. What does the R^2 statistic measure?</summary>

  <blockquote>

  R^2 measures the proportion of the response variable's variation that can be explained by a linear model.

  </blockquote>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Q5. What is an indicator variable and how are indicator variables related to linear regression?</summary>

  <blockquote>

  An indicator variable recasts a categorical variable in binary, numerical terms (typically 0 and 1), which allows linear regression to be run on a scatterplot associating the indicator variable with another numerical variable.

  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>(c) Which plot shows a stronger correlation? Explain your reasoning.</summary>

  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>(d) Data on heights were originally collected in centimeters, and then converted to inches. Does this conversion affect the correlation between husbands’ and wives’ heights?</summary>

  <blockquote>
  No, this conversion does not affect the correlation between the husbands' and wives' heights. The conversion is a scalar multiplier, meaning there is no transformation to the shape of the distribution. In other words, all of the values are multiplied by the same scalar, meaning the shape of the distribution is identical with different numbers on the axes.

  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>(c) Why might we want to fit a regression line to these data?</summary>

  <blockquote>
  We might want to fit a regression line to these data because the variables do increase together with a linear trend, and we want to make predictions about carbohydrate values using calorie values.

  <details>
    <summary>(d) Do these data meet the conditions required for fitting a least squares line?</summary>

  <blockquote>
  Yes, these data meet linearity, nearly normal residuals, and independent observations. The variability may not be constant, as it seems to grow as calories increase. However, the difference may not be enough to deter us from using linear regression.
